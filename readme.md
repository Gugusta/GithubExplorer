## 👨🏻‍💻 Hi everyone, this is a from a test that I did for a company. The idea is to create a web application that allows the user to search for a user on Github and see the repositories of that user.

To make this project more organized, I use ReactJS and Vite to create the project. I also use the Styled Components to create the styles of the project. To make the routes, I use the React Router Dom library.

## 👨🏻‍💻 To run this project you need to have NodeJS and Yarn installed on your machine.

First of all, you need to clone this repository. After that, you need to install the dependencies.
You only need to run "yarn" to install the node dependencies and use the command "yarn dev" to run the project. The project will be running on the port 5173. You can access it by typing "localhost:5173" on your browser.
